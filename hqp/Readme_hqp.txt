How to use
----------

This zip consists of the following subfolders:
\data
\games


"data" is the global folder for the resources, games/keenX stand for the extra local resources that improve the game feeling.

Just unpack that zip-file into the directory where the program is, or under linux into the game data root. If you want any of this to run with a mod you can place any of the directories in a mod subfolder.
You can also make your own HQ graphics and sounds if you just place them in the right directory. Ensure that you tileset and fontmaps are in .bmp format, rising points in .tga format. Sounds and music should be in .ogg format. You can change which song is played in which level by editing table.cfg in the \music subfolder.
