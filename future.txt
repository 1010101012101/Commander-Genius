Here are the features that I still want to implement:
-----------------------------------------------------

until 0.3:
- alt+enter for fullscreen, alt+F4 and/or alt+Q can be used to quickly close the application?
- Controls selection for player 2
- OpenGL new effects

until 0.4:
- User folder detection and save the files there!
- Ubuntu debs
- New Games Menu. Should run without the need of an episode!
- Commander Keen 4-6

until 0.5:
- Maybe Keen Dreams
- No plans for now!
