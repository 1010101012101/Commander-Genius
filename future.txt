Here are the features that I still want to implement:
-----------------------------------------------------

until 0.3:
- Write a instruction keys manual in the readme file
- tie up the code

until 0.4:
- User folder detection and save the files there!
- Ubuntu debs
- New Games Menu. Should run without the need of an episode!
- Commander Keen 4-6

until 0.5:
- OpenGL new effects
- Maybe Keen Dreams
- No more plans for now!
