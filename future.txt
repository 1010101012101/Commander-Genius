Here are the features that I still want to implement:
-----------------------------------------------------

until 0.4:
- Read all the text out of EXE-files. This should provide better support for mods!
- Update the Dialog Class. It should support more controls, and be easier to manage
- New Games Menu. Should run without the need of an episode!
- Improve the logic of Keen.exe reading for a better mod compatibility
- Implement the patch reading of pat files.
- Implement Audio Control
- improve the physics using floats
- User folder detection and save the files there!
- Ubuntu debs
- Commander Keen 4-6

until 0.5:
- OpenGL new effects
- Maybe Keen Dreams
- No more plans for now!
