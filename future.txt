Here are the features that I still want to implement:
-----------------------------------------------------

until 0.4:
- Improve the graphics of CG using SDL_BLit instead of arrays (CGfxEngine)
- Read all the text out of EXE-files. This should provide better support for mods!
- New Games Menu. Should run without the need of an episode!
- Improve the logic of Keen.exe reading for a better mod compatibility
- Implement a better Audio Controls. Volume, mute, etc.
- improve the physics using floats
- Ubuntu debs
- Commander Keen 4-6

until 0.5:
- OpenGL new effects
- Maybe Keen Dreams
- No more plans for now!
