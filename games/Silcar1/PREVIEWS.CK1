You have seen a short glimpse of the excitement that awaits in the rest of
this Commander Keen trilogy!
What you have seen are monsters I'd like to get into the next episode...

The second episode is "Flee from the Fleet!" which contains new features like
see-through windows, new aliens, and truly earth-shattering animation!
At least I hope to finish this one day.
