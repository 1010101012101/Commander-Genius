  <h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Thanks for downloading Commander Genius!
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Commander Genius is an open-source clone of
Commander Keen, which allows you to play the
original three games, and a majority of the mods
made for them.
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="about" id="about"></a>About Commander Genius</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Originally named CloneKeen Plus due to the origin of the original code.
    With the release of version 0.3, much of the base code had changed,
    and the name was changed as well.  Commander Genius is actively developed by
    a small group of programmers and artists, to fix bugs and improve the overall
    feel of the game.
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="install" id="install"></a>Installation Instructions</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Linux:<br>
    Just copy the files from the zip and run the game!  To add more games, just
    put them inside a folder in the games folder.<br>
    <br>
    Mac OSX:<br>
    You only need the application, but I would suggest copying the other files as
    well, as they will help with adding games and such.<br>
    <br>
    Windows:<br>
    Basically the same as Linux.<br>
    <br>
    Also if you want to use the HQ Audio, you may copy the snd and music files into
    the global folder with gfx.  For graphics, copy the images into the gfx folder
    inside of the folder for the game.

  <h2><a name="compatibility" id="compatibility"></a>Compatibility</h2>

  <blockquote>
    We have compatibilty with many platforms, the most prominent being Linux,
    Mac, and Windows.  It is recommended you use OpenGL v2.0 when trying to run
    our game, as lower may cause issues.  We have a good base for supporting mods,
    but we are working on improving this area of Commander Genius as well, and 
    would love your input on how to do so.
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="hqp" id="hqp"></a>High Quality Content</h2>

  <blockquote>
    I would like to dedicate this section to explaining how to make high quality
    graphics for Commander Genius.<br>
    If you decide you want to make your own,
    just take the original bmps, or your already modified ones, and name all the
    BMP files bitmap#.bmp, all the sprites sprite#.bmp, the tiles ck#tiles.bmp
    and the fonts fonts.bmp.<br>
    Once you have done all this, open them up in a graphics editing program and
    change them to have all colors, then save them as a 24 bit bmp.  Then you may
    modify them with whatever colors you wish, and put the results in the gfx
    folder of the game you wish to use the graphics.

  <h2><a name="faq" id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Q:</b> When I change to opengl-mode, the screen turns white and I can't do anything!  How do I change the mode back?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>A:</b> You can either delete "cgenius.cfg" or open it in a text editor and change it manually. Just put "opengl = 0" and it should change just that setting back.<br>
    The white screen means, that your graphics card doesn't support NPOT Textures. A video card with OpenGL 2.0 or later support should not have that problem.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Q:</b> Commander Genius is slow! Please help!
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>A:</b> OpenGL may help, but you must have a graphics card that supports NPOT-Textures.  (OpenGL 2.0 or later).<br>
    Try to lower the resolution, choose a lower filter, or decrease some sound settings and see if that helps.
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>Q:</b> When can I play Keen 4, 5 and 6 on CG?
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>A:</b> We are currently working on supporting play of Keens 4-6.  Keens 4-5 should be fully functional (although they won't be perfect) by the beginning of 2011. Keen 6 will be added a few months later.
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <b>Q:</b> I have a different question I want to ask!  What should I do?
