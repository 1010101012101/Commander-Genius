List of bugs that need to be fixed:
-----------------------------------
NOTE: This list represents the most critical bugs in my opinion. I consider it a todo list.
There is more stuff at github and also from emails I receive from people. Not everything is listed here.
Nevertheless I take a look on those other resources as well and see what I can do.

- Galaxy, when Keen finishes a level it doesn't look that good! Check! -> Transition effect is bad!
- Hud looks like shit in 640x480 mode
- 320x240 mode doesn't work at all.
- What about highscores in vorticons does it work?
- Do the help dialogs in vorticon at least work?
- Changing Games Resolution when game is running provides a big mess. ScrollBuffer is still wrong! (Tested in Galaxy)


Keen 1:

- Momentum bei Ice Cannon viel zu stark

Keen 4:
- Mimrock springt instant wenn man sich auf selber höhe wie er befindet.
- Level 1 secret (viele 1ups): Falling platform muss endlos fallen und nicht wieder zurückkehren
- Zurückkehren von falling platform an sich zu langsam, muss in etwa so schnell wie der Fall sein.
