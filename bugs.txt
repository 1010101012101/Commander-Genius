List of bugs that need to be fixed:
-----------------------------------
NOTE: This list represents the most critical bugs in my opinion. I consider it a todo list.
There is more stuff at github and also from emails I receive from people. Not everything is listed here.
Nevertheless I take a look on those other resources as well and see what I can do.

- Check Multiplayer.
- keen cannot carry other player.
- Game gets frozen when in multiplayer one finishes the level
- Look for all asserts to ensure, that the functions work again properly
