Keen flies into the Wormhole, utilizing what little information he could
get his hands on about Mortimer's 2nd Fleet.  Will he find it?  Will he stop
it in time?  Only you can help find out!


And from there, what lies ahead?  What evil scheme is Mortimer planning?  What
nefarious defenses does he have lying in wait for Keen?  Will the final 
confrontation be a toe-to-toe, lasers blasting showdown?  Or will there be some
unforseen strings attatched?

ONLY ID SOFTWARE KNOWS FOR SURE--GAH!






Thank you for playing my Keen1 Mod!
