                                 Published by
                         Apogee Software Productions
 
                         Developed and Programmed by 
                                 Id Software

      Never before has the shareware market seen a game of the quality of
    Commander Keen.  Ultra-high speed EGA scrolling graphics and animation
  at 40 frames per second!  (Cartoons are animated at just 24 frames/second.)

   You will need 640 RAM, with at least 530 free RAM to play Commander Keen.
    In other words, don't have too many RAM resident (TSR) programs running
    while you attempt to play Commander Keen.  You will also need an EGA or
                   VGA system.  CGA is not supported, sorry.

          Joystick and keyboard are both supported, but not the mouse.
    In some rare cases Commander Keen will detect a joystick when you really
     don't have one. This might cause the joystick mode to automatically be
     activated, when you really want to use the keyboard! To switch back to
       keyboard control after the game begins, simply press F4, then Esc.

   Apogee Software has many other exciting games, please send $6 if you would
    like a sample disk of other great games.  Mention disk size and the type
              of graphics system (CGA, EGA or VGA) that you have.

      If you notice any peculiar keyboard related problems, like a beeping
        keyboard, try starting Keen with the /K option, i.e. "KEEN1 /K".

                   *** COMMANDER KEEN: GOODBYE GALAXY ***
