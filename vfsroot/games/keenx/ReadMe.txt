======================= Episode X ========================


Thank you for downloading Commander Keen: Episode X, a Mod 
for Apogee and id Software's Commander Keen: Episode 1.

This Mod was in development for approximately 30 days, during
which time it underwent several graphical changes and many 
level designs.  The end result is presented as an attempt to
rekindle the magic, the spirit, and the fun that was provided
in the original series.  The difficulty rating of this Mod is
relatively easy, as the original Commander Keen: Episode 1 was
not necessarily difficult.  Nonetheless, Commander Keen: Episode
X is offered as a lighthearted "what-if" scenario, based on the
implications and imagination of what might have occured if the
first-person-shooter genre had not exploded in popularity.

====================== Compatibility ========================

This Mod was designed to work with Commander Keen: Episode 1,
Version 1.31.  It is incompatible with Version 1.1, and so to
avoid confusion and incompatibility problems, Version 1.31 was
included in the .zip file with the Mod.  Episode 1 of Commander
Keen is Shareware, and distribution of it is legal, so long as 
the .EXE file is not hacked or modified.  As you can see, the
only modifications here are in LEVELnn.CK1 and the use of the
CKxPatch utilities to change a few things.  

====================== Known Errors ==========================

The Yellow levels on the world map are additional, 'optional'
levels.  The original Commander Keen: Episode 1 contained 16
levels before its conclusion was reached.  Commander Keen: 
Episode X contains 18 levels, and the two additional levels are
not necessarily supportable on all systems.  Thus, if you see
a Yellow level on your world map, it may or may not be playable
to you.  If not, don't fret--there is nothing you're missing but
a few thousand points. ;-)

========================== Enjoy! ============================

Without further ado, all that is left is to copy the contents of
this .zip file into a new folder and run XkyKeen1.bat.  Thanks!
