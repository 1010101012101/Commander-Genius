Its incredible! Its amazing! Its a sequel of two totally pathetic mods! Its Shadow Keen 3: The Planet of Terror! Behold the mod of mystery; when will it be released? No one knows. What will it look like? No one knows. Who designed it? Well, actually, everyone knows that.

~      And Coming later: 

The Patchwork Mod Mk II!

Now this is really a mysterious mod. So mysterious, even I don't know what 99% of it will look like! To be designed by the Keen community, it is hoped that it will result in the same high quality as its prequel. Contribute to it today!!
