Yes! Pizza's candyfloss like remains rained down from the skies as Commander Keen walked up to the Dream Machine. He analysed all the complex controls and readouts on it, then hit it with a large mallet labeled 'thwacky stick'. The machine shook and sparked, then went silent. He had freed all the tuberians from their candy-enforced slavery! Everything around Keen wobbled in a disconcerting manner, his eyelids grew heavy, and he fell asleep...

Billy woke up, looking around the room, the early morning sun shining in his face. Nothing. No candy to be seen. Was it all just a dream?

Billy's mom entered the room.

"Good morning dear. I heard some news on TV that you'd be interested in," she said, sitting by him on the bed.

"What news?" Billy asked, still groggy.


"The President declared today National "I love Chocolate' Day. He said kids are allowed to pick one type of candy today, and they can eat as much as they like."

"Aw, mom, I'm not afraid of any stupid candy," Billy said. "But if it's okay with you, I'd rather not have any lolipops for awhile."
