A Commander Keen 1 total conversion:
Commander Keen in the Yorphius II
------------------------------------


===================================================
Hello, I'm KeenRush, also known as Tuomo Hepokangas
and I have done this total conversion.
I would like to hear comments or something about
this mod, so, please e-mail me to: tuomoh@mail.com!
This was behind really hard work!
Really big thanx to Andrew Durdin (adurdin) for
making cool Commander Keen editing programs. He
also converted my drawn image in to CK1-format.
Enjoy this mod and have fun!
===================================================


============================================================
Remeber this total conversion is only for Commander Keen 1!
And Commander Keen 1 is shareware and free to distribute, so
you can download it legally from the internet.
Note, this total conversion doesn't work with other
Commander Keen games than Commander Keen 1!
============================================================


========================================================
Install this total conversion by unzipping all the files
from yorphius.zip and replace older files of blank and
unmodified Commander Keen 1 with these new files.
Then run yorphius.exe to play it! And have fun! :)
========================================================


==========================================================
This total conversion includes:

+ new levels
  explore in the ancient planet of yorps in 16 levels
+ new world map
  ofcourse this is new too
+ new other maps
  those about iD and high score screen levels are new too
+ new enemies
  meet the new baddies
+ new treasures
  lot's of candy and other goodies to collect
+ new textures
  lot's of new graphics
+ other new stuff, menus, fonts, etc..
  they're new too
+ hex edited story and other stuff
  new again
+ new story
  ofcourse this is new too

And some more..
==========================================================


==========================================================
Here's some useful tips:

- save really often
- don't try to kill everything
- look for the secrets
- read those story and other stuff sections

Play carefully, you never know when something attacks.. :)
==========================================================


===============================================================
I know one bug what I couldn't fix! This bug comes when you
find teleport in one level and transport with it near the
secret level. It looks like something texture bug or something.
Then just walk left and it disappears. I'm sorry about this!
===============================================================


=========================================================
This file isn't anything help file. There is some
help stuff built in the game. Check them before you play.
And if you don't know how to play normal Commander Keen
games or something, please, don't e-mail me and ask. :)
=========================================================
