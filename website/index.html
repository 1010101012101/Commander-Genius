				<h1>Start/About</h1>
				<h2>Welcome to Commander Genius</h2>
				<p>
					Commander Genius, also known as CloneKeen Plus, is an
					engine which interprets the Commander Keen Invasion of
					the Vorticons series. As fans and developers, we try to
					implement new features, improve the gameplay, and give
					players an experience that feels like playing the
					original game. You will also need the original game
					files in addition to Commander Genius. Commander Keen:
					Marooned on Mars is shareware and may be freely, and
					legally downloaded elsewhere. Commander Keen: The Earth
					Explodes and Commander Keen: Keen Must Die! are
					registered versions which can be purchased from 3D
					Realms, Apogee, or purchased from someone willing to
					sell you their copy. If you still have these old games,
					then give Commander Genius a try! You will be surprised
					at how good they look and how much fun they are to play!

				<p>
					The right hand image that you see is Commander Keen in
					a dark room when playing the game normally under DOS
					(or for example DOS-Box). To the left you see the room
					using Commander Genius. Quite the difference, huh?! The
					darkness depends on the difficulty, so watch your step.
