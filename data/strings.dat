; ABOUT THIS FILE...
;
; This file contains string data for CloneKeen.
; Each string is prefaced with a string name, which is enclosed
; in square brackets. The next line after the string name
; is the first line of the string. The string data continues until
; another opening square bracket is seen.
;
; You can use a backslash to delimit special characters. A backslash
; followed by an open or close parenthese can be used to insert square
; brackets into the string text. A backslash followed by an uppercase H
; will turn on highlighting (text will appear red on a grey background).
; A lower case h will turn off highlighting (text will appear black on a
; white background). Two backslashes will result in a single backslash.
;
; You can specify numeric attributes for a string by adding them on to the
; same line as the string name after the closing bracket. For example this
; is used with strings defining text to go in dialog boxes to specify the
; dimensions of the dialog box.

The Elder Vorticon

The Vorticon Elder
says through the
statis field:

The Grand Intellect
is not from Vorticon
VI--he is from the
planet Earth. His evil
Mind-Belts control
their minds. They are
not evil. Please do
not shoot them, human.

Uh-oh.
[EP2_ESEQ_PART1]
After disabling the weaponry of
the Vorticon Mothership, Billy
heads for Earth.  Even great
space heroes need a nap after
defeating a vicious horde of
violence-bent aliens!
[EP2_ESEQ_PART2]
The Vorticon ship limps back
towards Vorticon VI to tell of
their defeat at the hands of
Commander Keen.  The Grand
Intellect will not be pleased.
[EP2_ESEQ_PART3_PAGE1] LEFT=2 TOP=17 WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=7
Look honey it snowed
outside! There's no
school!
[EP2_ESEQ_PART3_PAGE2] LEFT=2 TOP=17 WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=7
Wonderful. That gives me
time to travel to
Vorticon VI and solve the
mystery of the Grand
Intellect!
[EP2_ESEQ_PART3_PAGE3] LEFT=2 TOP=17 WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=7
Ok, hun, but you'd better
eat a nourishing vitamin
fortified bowl of Sugar
Stoopies first.

Ok Mom...
[EP3_SHIP1] LEFT=3 TOP=9 WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=8 TWIRLX=21 TWIRLY=6
You enter your ship, sit around
for a while, get bored, then
remember you have to find
the Grand Intellect!

        PRESS ENTER:
[EP3_SHIP2] LEFT=3 TOP=9 WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=8 TWIRLX=21 TWIRLY=6

[EP3_SHIP3] LEFT=3 TOP=9 WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=8 TWIRLX=21 TWIRLY=6
You feel like entering the ship
and taking a rest, but the

identity changes your mind.

[EP3_SHIP4] LEFT=3 TOP=9 WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=8 TWIRLX=21 TWIRLY=6
Entering the ship might be a

you need to find the Grand
Intellect and vanquish him!

No. It can't be!

Mortimer McMire!
[EP3_MORTIMER2] 
Mortimer has been a thorn in your
side for as long as you can
remember. Your IQ test score was
314-Mortimer's was 315. He always
held that over you, never letting
you forget for one day.
[EP3_MORTIMER3]
All the practical jokes, the
mental cruelty, the swirlies-each
memory makes your teeth grit
harder. And now he's out to
destroy Earth! You have had
enough!
[EP3_MORTIMER4]
"Alright Mortimer, what's the
problem? Why destroy Earth?"

"You and all those mental wimps
deserve to die! I'm the smartest
person in the galaxy. Aren't I
Mister THREE FOURTEEN! Ah,ha,ha!"
[EP3_MORTIMER5]
"I'll get you for that,Mortimer!"


"Come and try! You'll never get
past my hideous Mangling Machine!
Prepare to die, Commander Clown!"




[EP3_ESEQ_PAGE1] LEFT=0 TOP=18 WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=6
With Mortimer McMire out of the
picture, and his brain-wave belts no
longer controlling them, the Vorticons
are freed of their mental enslavement.
[EP3_ESEQ_PAGE2]
"Commander Keen, in honor of your
meritorious service in freeing us from
the Grand Intellect's mental chains,"
[EP3_ESEQ_PAGE3]
"I and the other Vorticons you haven't
slaughtered want to award you the
Big V, our highest honor."
[EP3_ESEQ_PAGE4]
"Thank you!"
