The menu and the game are a bit different from how they used to be, we'll explain what is different and how it works here.

KEY           WHAT IT DOES

Arrows        Move Keen around

Ctrl          Jump

Alt           Use Pogo/Stop Pogo
              (if you have one)

Spacebar      Fire raygun
              (if it has charges)

You can redefine these keys in the controls menu.


OTHER IMPORTANT KEYS

Enter      Status screen

F1            Help!

ESC           Opens Menu

USING THE NEW MENU

When you use the menu, it works a lot like most menus would.

The main things to know are that the High Quality Graphics and Sound can be enabled and disabled in the options menu.  (NOT AVAILABLE YET)

And also the graphics menu isn't working the best yet, it won't always display the right resolutions to choose from in the menu.

Other than that, there is the saving and loading system, currently it is limited to 10 slots, but eventually we will make it dynamically expand forever to allow you to save as many times as you wish.

The other major change is the introduction of an in game menu, I aimed to make it as similar to Keens 4-6 as I could, but it still might not be ideal.

PLAYING THE GAME

There isn't much difference in the game itself, other than the multiplayer modes that aren't implemented yet.

But you will have to worry about a little bit of difference from the original games, as well as an added difficulty option, which changes certain things in the games.

If you are playing a mod, you are warned, while we have made some major steps to implementing better support for mods into our engine.

Currently it only loads strings and graphics from your mods, it does not apply any changes that your patch made to the file.
